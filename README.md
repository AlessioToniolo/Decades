# Decades
Welcome to my Decades project! This was a school project that I opted to create
using my programming skills and knowledge.

It is a website with an interactive element that allows you to experience the project from anywhere of course.

## How I did it
I created an [express](https://expressjs.com/) app with a single route of the index, then using a library called
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) I created a simple web game/ui/interface in JavaScript. The library is based
off of the Processing library for Java which I have background in, so I used my knowledge of processing for Java
in order to use the JS library confidently.

The content part was part of the actual project and aligned to its rubric, so I will not go in depth on that.
