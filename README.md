Decades Project

## About
A science project and project for my portfolio

## How I made it
I created a parralax scrolling feature by rotating a div inside of a rotated outer wrapper.
I added svgs and a multitude of images to create a timeline effect.
Then I added some JS and jQuery to animate some svgs and images in addition to characters.

## Contributing
Simply create a PR and I will review it.
